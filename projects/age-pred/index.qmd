## Introduction

This project leverages a CNN-based approach to predict age from facial images using PyTorch and the UTK dataset. Utilizing a ResNet10 architecture, the model processes over 9,000 images to achieve an average prediction error of ±4 years. Through extensive hyperparameter optimization—including learning rate scheduling and regularization—the model's accuracy improved by 28%, and a Streamlit UI was developed for real-time demographic analysis.

## Output

Here is a screenshot from the Streamlit UI demonstrating real-time age prediction:
