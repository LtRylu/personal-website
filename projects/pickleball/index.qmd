## Introduction

This project analyzes pickleball players in video footage to measure shot speed, player movement, and overall court positioning. It leverages **YOLOv8** for player and ball detection and incorporates a **fine-tuned ResNet50** model to enhance keypoint precision and positioning analysis. By combining these computer vision techniques, this project demonstrates a real-time, in-depth approach to performance analytics and provides a great opportunity to refine machine learning and computer vision skills.
