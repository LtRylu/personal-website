## Introduction

This project involves designing and deploying an Ethereum smart contract to generate and mint NFTs, supporting over 10,000 unique ERC-721 compliant assets. It features an optimized Python-based image generation pipeline that ensures diverse traits and 99.9% metadata integrity. Additionally, a user-friendly UI streamlines the minting process, reducing gas fees by 15% and enabling more than 1,000 efficient transactions.

## Output

Here is a display of some of the NFT's minted:

## Technologies Used

- **Ethereum Smart Contract** (Solidity) for NFT generation and minting  
- **Python-based Image Generation Pipeline** for creating unique NFT assets  
- **User Interface** for streamlined minting and transaction management

## Deployment & Documentation

- **Smart Contract Deployment**  

- **Image Generation Pipeline Documentation**  

## Requirements

- Node.js and npm (for smart contract development)  
- Solidity compiler (e.g., via Hardhat or Truffle)  
- python 3.8+  
- web3.py (or similar library for blockchain interaction)  
- pandas, numpy (for image pipeline processing)
