## Bio

I’m a senior at UCLA majoring in Statistics and Data Science with a Data Science Engineering minor, graduating in Spring 2026. My current focus is on building deployable AI systems that distill complex data into decisions, and I’ll be sharpening that perspective further while studying abroad at Fudan University in Shanghai during Spring 2026.

Across research and industry internships I’ve pursued projects that bridge modeling innovation with production rigor—most recently crafting a computer vision pipeline for pickleball analytics, architecting BiteBuddy AI to personalize nutrition journeys, and codifying an algorithmic trading stack around the ORB strategy. I love iterating on end-to-end workflows: designing experiments, curating data, operationalizing models, and telling the story behind the metrics.

Outside the lab, you’ll still find me in competitive arenas—pickleball courts, snowy backcountry, or poker tables—continually refining the same pattern recognition and strategic thinking that drive my work. I stay plugged into emerging ML research, responsible AI conversations, and data product design trends to keep my skill set sharp and future-oriented.
